## Documentation Expertise

As a Senior Technical Writer with 8+ years of experience, I've created comprehensive documentation across federal government, SaaS, and open-source platforms. My work focuses on user-first design, developer experience, and 508-compliance.

### API & Developer Documentation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="OpenAPI Specification & API Reference">
    I specialize in creating developer-focused API documentation using OpenAPI Specification (OAS). At the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, I authored comprehensive API reference docs and implemented automated validation using Spectral and GitHub Actions. I've also worked extensively with webhook documentation and REST API guides across multiple platforms.

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Developer Experience & Onboarding">
    I've built scalable onboarding content and developer guides that reduce time-to-first-success. My work includes creating interactive tutorials, code samples, and SDK documentation. At Relish, I delivered 1,300+ user-focused pages that measurably improved developer adoption and reduced support tickets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="git-branch" title="Docs-as-Code Workflows">
    I implement and manage docs-as-code pipelines using GitHub, MkDocs, Mintlify, and Docusaurus. My expertise includes CI/CD integration, automated linting with Vale, and accessibility validation. I've built production-ready documentation servers with automated build processes that improve reliability and release speed.
