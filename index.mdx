###
Hello World, I'm Mackenzie! 
description: "Welcome to Mackenzie.TechDocs, where you can access the latest documentation that I have been working on."

##
Who Am I?
I'm a strategic and detail-oriented Senior Technical Writer with ~7 years of experience crafting clear, accurate, and user-focused documentation across a range of industries—including SaaS, applications, defense, manufacturing, and materials. From API documentation and configuration guides to user manuals and knowledge base content, I translate complex technical concepts into accessible resources that empower users and drive business outcomes.

My work spans the full documentation lifecycle: planning, writing, editing, and publishing, often in close collaboration with cross-functional teams including Product, Engineering, Customer Success, and Sales. I’m experienced with tools like Postman, Swagger, DevOps, Jira, and CMS platforms, and I bring both a collaborative mindset and a results-driven approach to every project.

Outside of work, I’m a passionate meteorology and aviation enthusiast who’s always up for a good hike—or a well-timed storm chase.
