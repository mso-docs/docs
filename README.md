# Mackenzie.TechDocs

Welcome to Mackenzie.TechDocs, where you can access some of my sample work. I am actively developing this page at the moment, so things may change from time to time. This dummy text's subject to change.

Here, you can find several types of documentation:
- API Documentation
- How To Guides
- Configuration Manuals
- White Papers
- Quick Reference Guides

### Development

I am going to see if this format handles code snippets. If so, the dummy Python command will appear in proper syntax below.

```
print(f"Hello World!")
```

As another test, I am going to try to put json next:
```
itemName = {
    "gilgamesh" : "fruit",
    "midgarsommr" : "vegetable",
    "chocobo" : "sugar",
    "Famfrit" : "steak",
    "aether" : "grain"
}
```
If these work properly, the samples will appear as code blocks. If not then... Oops.
