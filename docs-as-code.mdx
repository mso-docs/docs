<Info>
  My documentation workflow follows a full <strong>docs-as-code</strong> model: version control, automated CI/CD, reproducible builds, and an opinionated toolchain.<br />
  Ensure you have Node.js v19+ and a valid <code>docs.json</code> configuration file before continuing.

This guide outlines how I run, preview, validate, and deploy documentation across my projects as a Senior Technical Writer specializing in docs-as-code systems.

## Why Docs-as-Code?

Treating documentation like code means:

- **Version control**: Every change is tracked in Git with full history
- **Code review**: Docs go through pull requests and peer review
- **Automated testing**: Linters, link checkers, and spell checkers run in CI
- **Continuous deployment**: Changes merge to main and deploy automatically
- **Developer-friendly**: Use the same tools and workflows as engineering

### Writing & Editing

I write all documentation in **MDX** (Markdown with JSX components), which allows:

- Rich interactive components alongside standard Markdown
- Reusable snippets and callouts
- Type-safe content when paired with TypeScript
