description: 'How I build, preview, lint, and deploy documentation using modern docs-as-code practices.'

<Info>
  My documentation workflow follows a full <strong>docs-as-code</strong> model: version control, automated CI/CD, reproducible builds, and an opinionated toolchain.<br />
  Ensure you have Node.js v19+ and a valid <code>docs.json</code> configuration file before continuing.
</Info>

This guide outlines how I run, preview, validate, and deploy documentation across my projects as a Senior Technical Writer specializing in docs-as-code systems.

## Local Development

I iterate quickly using a live local preview server.

**Step 1:** Install the documentation CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2:** Navigate to your documentation directory and run:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A live preview becomes available at `http://localhost:3000`, updating automatically as you edit MDX, components, or configuration files.

### Custom Ports

To run multiple documentation sites simultaneously, specify a custom port:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If the requested port is taken, the CLI automatically selects the next available one:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Keeping Tooling in Sync

Version alignment is critical in docs-as-code environments. If local previews differ from production output, update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

This ensures consistent rendering across local development, preview builds, and CI pipelines.

## Quality Checks & Link Validation

Broken links and structural issues are common pain points in documentation workflows. I use the CLI to proactively validate all internal references:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

This complements additional linters I use (Vale, Spectral, Markdownlint) to maintain content, schema, and style quality.

## Deployment Workflow

<Tip>
  Ideal for teams using Git-based workflows: unlimited editors, automated previews, and branch-based deployments under the Pro plan and above.
</Tip>

Successful deployments surface clean build logs and validation checks, similar to:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

I typically deploy documentation via GitHub Actions, automating formatting, linting, building, and publishing to production environments.

## Editor & Formatting Setup

Consistent formatting reduces diff churn and improves PR reviews.
Recommended VSCode extensions:

- **MDX** — syntax highlighting & linting
- **Prettier** — formatting
- **EditorConfig** — consistent whitespace
- **Markdownlint** — optional markdown standards enforcement

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This usually indicates an incompatible Node version.<br /><br />
    Steps:<br />
    1. Remove Mintlify: <code>npm remove -g mintlify</code><br />
    2. Upgrade Node to v19+<br />
    3. Reinstall: <code>npm install -g mintlify</code>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Unknown or inconsistent CLI errors'>
    Try clearing the Mintlify cache directory:<br /><br />
    <code>rm -rf ~/.mintlify</code><br />
    Then restart:<br />
    <code>mintlify dev</code>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
